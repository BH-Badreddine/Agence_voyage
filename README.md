### In this project, my colleague and I designed and developed a web application for a virtual travel agency. We used HTML, CSS, and jQuery for the frontend, while the backend
### was managed with PHP and a MySQL relational database. The application allows travelers to explore and book a variety of tourist offers, including accommodations, flights, 
### Omra packages, and special promotions. Additionally, we developed an administrative interface using PHP to facilitate comprehensive and efficient management of the application.
